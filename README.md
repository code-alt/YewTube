# Yew Tube

For those of us who want a peaceful alternative to the rabbit hole that is YouTube...I bring you: Yew Tube. 

This app makes calls to the YouTube API with jQuery's get() method, to pull only the most *essential* results for the end user. That way, you won't end up watching a bird sitting on a cat riding a turtle around when you should be watching React tutorials. :)
